					"To help reduce plastic waste at the needed scale, it proposes an accelerated transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies, the removal of subsidies and a shift towards more circular approaches towards reduction. ", 
					"Titled From Pollution to Solution: a global assessment of marine litter and plastic pollution, the report shows that there is a growing threat, across all ecosystems, from source to sea. "

			"headline": "Warning against seal disturbance as Cornish Seal Sanctuary celebrates first release of new season",
			"body": 
				[
					"A grey seal pup found injured and starving to death on a Cornish beach has been successfully released back into the wild, after receiving expert care at the Cornish Seal Sanctuary. The pup, named ‘Curry’, was the first to leave the Sanctuary this season after being rescued from a west Cornwall beach last month.", 
					"Volunteers from British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) were initially called to assess him on 10th September, and it was quickly decided he would need to be transferred into the care of the Cornish Seal Sanctuary.", 
					"However, on arrival, he was found with a heart drawn around him in the sand, demonstrating how close members of the public had come to the pup. As a result, the Sanctuary is now reminding people to keep their distance if they spot a pup on the beach. Tamara Cooper, Curator for the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, says, “Getting too close to a pup on the beach can result in abandonment by the mother, who may be watching from the water, and can be fatal to the pup.",
					"Pups also need time to rest and conserve energy,  so getting too close can result in them being frightened back into the water, which can cause them to waste precious energy and be injured – particularly if they are startled off rocks.",
					"“That’s why it’s incredibly important that, if a pup or seal is spotted, dogs are immediately put on a lead and everyone stays as far away as possible. While we don’t believe this was the case for Curry, we do ask that, even if a pup looks like it needs help, people continue to give them space. Following his initial vet visit and move the Sanctuary, Curry was found to be malnourished and dehydrated, with a high temperature. He also had ulcers in his mouth, an injury to his right flank and a large swelling on one of his joints. At just three-weeks-old, he needed all the help he could get. However, with the support of the Sanctuary’s animal care team and their vets, Head & Head in Helston, Curry made a speedy recovery, leaving the charity at a healthy weight of 34.5kg on 25th October to start his second chance at life. Tamara says: “We are so pleased to see our first successful release of the new season, and, as with every release, it’s always a proud moment for our team. Caring for these incredible animals is our core mission, alongside supporting our year-round residents. It will no doubt be a busy season ahead, so any help we can get to buy pup supplies will be much appreciated.”"

			"headline": "One of the world’s biggest sea snails at risk of extinction",
			"body": [
				"Horse conchs, the flashy marine snails that inhabit Florida’s colossal state seashell, live shorter lives and reproduce later than previously understood, according to new research that warns the Gulf of Mexico population could be nearing collapse.", 
				"Spindle-shaped shells that can grow to more than a foot and red-orange bodies bright as traffic cones make horse conchs some of the most eye-catching species on the beaches of the southeastern United States. They were once even bigger: Historic Florida photographs show tourists lugging horse conch shells half the length of a small child. Those sizes aren’t seen anymore, prompting researchers to ask why.",
				"Scientists used sclerochronology—the shell version of dendrochronology, or tree-ring science—to investigate the lifespans of the animals whose off-white shells have been recorded as long as two feet from pointy top to funnel tip. The sizes had led some scientists to assume the predatory snails could live half a century or more, with females sending hundreds of thousands of tiny conchs into the sea over decades. The new research shows that’s not the case.",
				"At seven to 10 years, “the actual lifespan is significantly shorter,” says Gregory S. Herbert, the University of South Florida marine ecologist who led the study, published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE. The research further suggests that females spawn late in life. Since the largest horse conchs living today are both smaller and younger than the historic shells used in the study, “the largest females left in the wild could have few lifetime spawning events, if any,” the article warns, putting the Gulf population in crisis.",
				"Earlier research showed the conchs’ sizes have declined over decades, “the universal sign that a tipping point is near,” says Herbert. Like other marine animals living near heavily populated coasts, horse conchs have lost considerable habitat to development and pollution, including favorite breeding grounds along mud flats and seagrass beds. Their Gulf habitat is also warming due to climate change, which scientists think further pressures the animals, based on the negative effects extra heat has on other big mollusks. But scientists say the more immediate threat shrinking their numbers and sizes is overharvesting, primarily for their highly sought-after shells."
