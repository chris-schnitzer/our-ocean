			Our Ocean is dedicated to restoring the

			<p className="moreInfoIntro">Marine pollution occurs when substances used or
			spread by humans, such as industrial, agricultural 
			and residential waste, particles, noise, excess 
			carbon dioxide or invasive organisms enter the ocean
			and cause harmful effects there.</p>

			<h2>Is there a fix to Marine Pollution?</h2>
			<p>Many national laws, as well as international 
			agreements, now forbid dumping of harmful materials 
			into the ocean, although enforcing these regulations
			 remains a challenge.</p>
			<p>Many pollutants still persist in the environment, 
			difficult to fully remove. Chemical pollutants often
			 cannot be broken down for long periods of time, or 
			 they increase in concentration as they move up the 
			 food web. Because plastic is thought to take hundreds 
			 of years to break down, it poses a threat to the marine 
			 environment for centuries.</p>
			<p>Isolated efforts to restore estuaries and bays have 
			met with some success, but pollution gets trapped in 
			marine sediment and makes complete clean-ups nearly 
			impossible.</p>
			<p>Moving forward, encouraging recycling and reuse can
			 minimize plastic pollution. Dampening unnecessary lights 
			 at night can limit light pollution. And encouraging 
			 responsible chemical-use through consumer and political 
			 actions can protect the environment for the future.</p>
